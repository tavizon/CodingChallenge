# Kink.com Coding Challenge - Modal

## Goal
Using the code in this directory as a starting point, create a confirmation
modal that asks the user to confirm their intent after clicking the **cancel**
button.

## Requirements
- When the user mouses over the **cancel** button, the mouse pointer should
indicate that it is a clickable link.
- The modal window should include the following:
	* Text: `Are you sure you want to cancel your subscription?`
	* **No** button on the left
	* **Yes - Cancel** button on the right
- When the user clicks the **No** button, the modal should disappear.
- When the user clicks the **Yes - Cancel** button:
	* The modal's content should be updated to display the text `Subscription
	successfully cancelled!`. This modal should close after 2 seconds.
	* The **cancel** button on the page should be replaced with the text
	`cancelled`.

## Guidelines
- You **may** use third-party JavaScript or CSS libraries to complete this task.
- You **may** edit any of the files in this directory.
- Please use comments to document your code as you would in a professional
work product.

## Submission
-  Clone the `modal` directory from this repository to your local environment
and submit the entire directory as a zip file via email.
